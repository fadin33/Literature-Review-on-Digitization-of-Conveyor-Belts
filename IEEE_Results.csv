A DT is a system-of-systems which goes far beyond the traditional computer-based simulations and analysis. It is a replication of all the elements, processes, dynamics, and firmware of a physical system into a digital counterpart. The two systems (physical and digital) exist side by side, sharing all the inputs and operations using real-time data communications and information transfer. With the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), 3D models, next generation mobile communications (5G/6G), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), distributed computing, Transfer Learning (TL), and electronic sensors, the digital/virtual counterpart of the real-world system is able to provide seamless monitoring, analysis, evaluation and predictions. The DT offers a platform for the testing and analysing of complex systems, which would be impossible in traditional simulations and modular evaluations. However, the development of this technology faces many challenges including the complexities in effective communication and data accumulation, data unavailability to train Machine Learning (ML) models, lack of processing power to support high fidelity twins, the high need for interdisciplinary collaboration, and the absence of standardized development methodologies and validation measures. Being in the early stages of development, DTs lack sufficient documentation. In this context, this survey paper aims to cover the important aspects in realization of the technology. The key enabling technologies, challenges and prospects of DTs are highlighted.

Smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory/manufacturing are the three key services to form the backbone of IIoT. Network slicing management is of paramount importance in the face of IIoT services with diversified requirements. It is important to have a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing management to provide guidance for future research in this field. In this paper, we provide a thorough investigation and analysis of network slicing management in its general use cases as well as specific IIoT services including smart transportation, smart energy and smart factory, and highlight the advantages and drawbacks across many existing works/surveys and this current survey in terms of a set of important criteria. In addition, we present an architecture for intelligent network slicing management for IIoT focusing on the above three IIoT services. For each service, we provide a detailed analysis of the application requirements and network slicing architecture, as well as the associated enabling technologies. Further, we present a deep understanding of network slicing orchestration and management for each service, in terms of orchestration architecture, AI-assisted management and operation, edge computing empowered network slicing, reliability, and security. For the presented architecture for intelligent network slicing management and its application in each IIoT service, we identify the corresponding key challenges and open issues that can guide future research. To facilitate the understanding of the implementation, we provide a case study of the intelligent network slicing management for integrated smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory. Some lessons learnt include: 1) For smart transportation, it is necessary to explicitly identify service function chains (SFCs) for specific applications along with the orchestration of underlying VNFs/PNFs for supporting such SFCs; 2) For smart energy, it is crucial to guarantee both ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability; 3) For smart factory, resource management across heterogeneous network domains is of paramount importance. We hope that this survey is useful for both researchers and engineers on the innovation and deployment of intelligent network slicing management for IIoT.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2022.3158270","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/R030863/1); Singapore University of Technology and Design(grant numbers:SRGISTD-2021-165); Hong Kong RGC Research Impact Fund (RIF)(grant numbers:R5060-19); General Research Fund (GRF)(grant numbers:152221/19E,152203/20E,152244/21E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872310); Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Commission(grant numbers:R2020A045); LEO Dr. David P.

Furthermore, since ICSs are often employed in critical infrastructures (e.g., nuclear plants) and manufacturing companies (e.g., chemical industries), attacks can lead to devastating physical damages. In dealing with this security requirement, the research community focuses on developing new security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), facilitated by leveraging modern machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms require a testing platform and a considerable amount of data to be trained and tested accurately. To satisfy this prerequisite, Academia, Industry, and Government are increasingly proposing testbed (i.e., scaled-down versions of ICSs or simulations) to test the performances of the IDSs. Furthermore, to enable researchers to cross-validate security systems (e.g., security-by-design concepts or anomaly detectors), several datasets have been collected from testbeds and shared with the community. In this paper, we provide a deep and comprehensive overview of ICSs, presenting the architecture design, the employed devices, and the security protocols implemented. We then collect, compare, and describe testbeds and datasets in the literature, highlighting key challenges and design guidelines to keep in mind in the design phases. Furthermore, we enrich our work by reporting the best performing IDS algorithms tested on every dataset to create a baseline in state of the art for this field.

However, these augmentations and automation introduce security threats to network systems of smart airports. Cyber-attackers demonstrated the susceptibility of IoT systems and networks to Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), due to hardware constraints, software flaws or IoT misconfigurations. With the increasing complexity of attacks, it is imperative to safeguard IoT networks of smart airports and ensure reliability of services, as cyber-attacks can have tremendous consequences such as disrupting networks, cancelling travel, or stealing sensitive information.

In dynamic scenarios, fast multiobject detection and tracking are crucial. Many objects commonly found in household and industrial environments are represented by cylindrical shapes. Thus, it is available for robots to manipulate them through the real-time detection of elliptic shape primitives formed by the circular tops of these objects. We devise an efficient algorithm of the detection of elliptic shape primitives, which in turn enables robust and real-time robotic manipulations of such objects. The proposed algorithm incorporates the information of elliptic edge curvature, splits complex curves into arcs, classifies the arcs into different quadrants of a candidate elliptic shape, determines the quality of arc selection for ellipse fitting, and then retrieves the corresponding elliptic shape primitive. Our algorithm provides either faster or more accurate ellipse detection results than the current state-of-the-art methods, irrespective of challenging scenarios such as occluded or overlapping ellipses. This is verified by performance comparison with six state-of-the-art elliptic shape detection algorithms on four public image datasets. The algorithm has been integrated on robots to demonstrate the ability to carry out accurate robotic manipulations (tracking, grasping, and stacking) of cylindrical objects in real time.

In this context the Operational Technology (OT) and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) domains grow together to an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Interconnecting heterogeneous assets and services with each other that have typically not communicated before, arise multiple challenges. In order to enable physical assets to mutually negotiate the production process, they can be encapsulated by software components to form Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). However, how related Asset Administration Shells (AASs) will be implemented, is not yet defined in detail. While a number of approaches are under discussion, we assume that in the end exchanged information needs to be interoperable on a semantic level. In this paper, we argue that the oneM2M standard offers the required functionalities by allowing the use of Semantic Web technologies to formally describe interactions and exchanged information.

To address this challenge, in this paper we present our work on modeling digital twins of manufacturing facilities using UML. UML class diagrams are used to describe static dependencies between entities, as well as to monitor and analyze the dynamic verification and quality aspects of manufacturing such as fault detection and consistency checks. Utilizing the key relevant features of UML in our approach, the designed class diagrams are used and enriched with behavioral models serving as digital twins which can be updated by live data from the manufacturing plant.

Superimposed on these maps is the true performance of each engine, obtained through real-time sensors. In this bespoke virtual space, an engineer can rapidly analyze the health of different engine sub-systems across the fleet within seconds.

Postural-based yoga increases flexibility, energy, overall brain activity and reduces stress, blood pressure, and back pain. Body Postural Alignment is a very important aspect while performing yogic asanas. Many yogic asanas including uttanasana, kurmasana, ustrasana, and dhanurasana, require bending forward or backward, and if the asanas are performed incorrectly, strain in the joints, ligaments, and backbone can result, which can cause problems with the hip joints.

This paper contributes to a better understanding of business models for smart services and establishes a common morphological framework to define different types of business models for smart services. Six types of business models of industrial smart services were identified during the research based, which was based on a literature review and interviews with leading experts in the field of smart services. The validation of the developed types and its practical application was carried out as part of the German research project Smart-Farming-World and its four developed use cases.

Automatic generation of Digital Twins is an emerging research field and can reduce time and costs.

In this context, Industry 4.0 is promoting the digitization of traditional production systems towards intelligent factories with highly automated and rapidly adaptable capabilities based on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS). This digitization process is currently being leveraged by the so-called Asset Administration Shell (AAS), a standardized digital representation of an asset that provides the uniform access to the asset information. Additionally, the AASs offer the digital basis for future autonomous systems, where intelligent AASs may perform collaborative functions to enhance industrial processes. However, currently such solutions are still at an early stage of maturity. In this sense, this paper explores the adoption of a Multi-agent Systems (MAS) approach to provide the required intelligent and collaborative aspects for the traditional AAS.

These drawbacks are crucial especially if the reconstructed models have to be used for quality check, inspection or repair in manufacturing environments where we have to deal with large objects resulting in very dense 3D meshes. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown that are able to automatically learn and find more accurate and reliable results, without the need for setting manually parameters. In this work, motivated by the aforementioned requirements, we propose a fast and reliable denoising method that can be effectively applied for reconstructing very dense noisy 3D models. The proposed method applies conditional variational autoencoders on face normals. Extensive evaluation studies carried out using a variety of 3D models verify that the proposed approach achieves plausible reconstruction outputs, very relative or even better of those proposed by the literature, in considerably faster execution times.","2378-363X","978-1-7281-2927-3","10.1109/INDIN41052.2019.8972221","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8972221","3D mesh denoising;data driven normal filtering;variational autoencoders.","","","3","","32","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, only high-fidelity simulation environments that precisely reconstruct the behavioral patterns of real systems can guarantee a successful transfer from simulation to reality (sim-to-real). Many existing industrial simulation tools provide libraries for various industrial devices, which simplify the development efforts significantly, but they generally lack the ability to model the system dynamics and often fail to generate a realistic representation when the system performance is sensitive to the modeling deviation. For example, robots equipped with intelligent algorithms potentially lead to task failure if the software is sensitive to the variation of the system dynamics. In this paper, we design a novel simulation platform for industrial manufacturing use cases consisting of a cooperative robot and a modular manufacturing device. With the dynamic model of the robot integrated into a manufacturing digital-twining software, the platform achieves high simulation fidelity by incorporating the effect of the robot dynamics to the control logic of the industrial tasks. Also, the simulation can exchange data with the real robot via an open protocol, which enables the simultaneous test of the real and simulated systems. Two experiments are conducted on the simulation platform to validate its fidelity in terms of the consistent control logic with the real system. Also, a workpiece distribution use case is studied to show how the simulation platform is used to develop a task-planning algorithm for a manufacturing application.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2022.3190096","Kinova Inc.; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:543881-19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827559","Simulation and animation;software tools for robot programming;software-hardware integration for robot systems;robot simulation;industrial software","Robots;Service robots;Task analysis;Robot sensing systems;Robot kinematics;Manufacturing;Matlab","","3","","24","IEEE","12 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the input image is downsized, of which the reduction ratio is determined by iteratively applying binary morphological Closing operation. Such morphology-driven image downsizing not only saves the computation time of subsequent processes, but the key features necessary for the successful decoding is preserved. Then, high or low contrast areas are decomposed by applying the grayscale morphological Closing and Opening operators to the downsized image, and subtracting the two resulting output images from each other. If necessary, these areas are further subjected to decomposition to obtain finer separation of high and low regions. Having done the preprocessing, two approaches are proposed to do the binarization: (1) GMM is used to estimate a binarization threshold for each region (2) the binarization problem is treated as an image-translation task and hence a deep learning approach based on the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is trained using the high or low contrast areas as conditional inputs. Our method solves the difficulty of choosing a proper preset sampling mask in conventional adaptive thresholding methods.

In backscatter systems, the use of this method will increase penetration and improve image quality of concealed objects located deeper below the surface. Specifically, different depths within an object can be probed simultaneously. In CT, our MEXP approach mitigates the main disadvantages of the conventional dual-energy technique: a) distortion of image of the boundaries between regions with large difference in density; b) limited range of object thickness where material decomposition is valid; c) ambiguity and artifacts caused by sampling different regions due to motion of the object between interlaced pulses with distinct energies.

Two classes of materials were chosen to compose the dataset which went through a dataset resampling and data augmentation. The binary object classification is performed by a residual neural network (Resnet). Using a pre-trained model, a transfer learning method called feature extraction was applied, adjusting the network to respond to the addressed task by updating the final layer’s weights, biases, and number of neurons. An extensive test was conducted to define the best set of hyperparameters for the application. The neural network was tested 10 times on every combination of these hyperparameters values and the average accuracy on test dataset defined the best set. Adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) optimizer, a learning rate of 0.001, and batch size of 16 proved to have an improvement over other combinations, achieving an average accuracy on the test set of 92.876%.

While approaches for automatic, sensor-based object recognition have been proposed, e.g., based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they assume the availability of real-world photos which is not given in the setting of Additive Manufacturing. Hence, we develop an approach to render realistic virtual images and demonstrate their suitability to recognize real-world objects.

In order to tag a physical object in the MAR world, a smart phone running MAR-based applications must know the precise location of an object in the real world. Tracking and localizing a large number of objects in an industrial environment can become a huge burden for the smart phone due to compute and battery requirements. In this paper we propose GLAMAR, a novel framework that leverages externally provided geo-location of the objects and IMU sensor information (both of which can be noisy) from the objects to 10-cate them precisely in the MAR world. GLAMAR offloads heavy-duty computation to the edge and supports building MAR-based applications using commercial development packages. We develop a regenerative particle filter and a continuously improving transformation matrix computation methodology to dramatically improve the positional accuracy of objects in the real and the AR world. Our prototype implementation on Android platform using ARCore shows the practicality of GLAMAR in developing MAR-based applications with high precision, efficiency, and more realistic experience. GLAMAR is able to achieve less then 10cm error compared to the ground truth for both stationary and moving objects and reduces the CPU overhead by 83% and battery consumption by 80% for mobile devices.","","978-1-7281-5943-0","10.1109/SEC50012.2020.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355612","Mobile Augmented Reality;Localization;Tracking","Automation;Prototypes;Particle filters;Batteries;Noise measurement;Smart phones;Augmented reality","","1","","77","IEEE","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is driven by the need for developing and applying solutions for digital production. Digitization receives constantly increasing attention in many areas, especially in industry. The common theme is to make things smart by using intelligent computer technology. Especially in the last decade there have been many attempts to improve existing processes in factories, for example, in production logistics, also with deploying cyber-physical systems. An initiative that explores challenges and opportunities for robots in such a setting is the RoboCup Logistics League. Since its foundation in 2012 it is an international effort for research and education in an intra-warehouse logistics scenario. During seven years of competition a lot of knowledge and experience regarding autonomous robots was gained. This knowledge and experience shall provide the basis for further research in challenges of future production. The focus of our SMART-FACTORY is to create a stimulating environment for research on logistics robotics, for teaching activities in computer science and electrical engineering programmes as well as for industrial users to study and explore the feasibility of future technologies. Building on a very successful history in the RoboCup Logistics League we aim to provide stakeholders with a dedicated facility oriented at their individual needs.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274766","logistics robotics;Industry 4.0;smart factory;RoboCup Logistics League;RCLL","Production;Production facilities;Logistics;Smart manufacturing;Robots;Industries;Complexity theory","","1","","31","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this paper proposes a method to automatically elicit requirements from graphical design documents and generate control applications for module-based automation systems. An extension to the VDI/VDE/NAMUR 2658 standard and ANSI/ISA-88 is introduced to cover discrete manufacturing systems. An example of a packaging system is used to illustrate the idea.

With principal component analysis (PCA) for data dimensionality reduction, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify sorghum varieties and discriminate whether sorghum grains are adulterated. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposed machine vision based method and SVM model with radial basis function (RBF) kernel achieved an accuracy of 84.71 % for the classification of glutinous sorghum and japonica sorghum.

This chapter provides an overview about this divide and summarizes studies about the state of digitalization across logistics infrastructure (seaports, airports, warehousing), logistics execution (road transport, sea transport, air transport, and courier, express, and parcel delivery), and logistics services and advisory. The digital transformation of seaports and airports is happening slower than in other logistics areas, where, for instance, only 3% of container terminals are (semi)automated. Meanwhile, in ca. 30–40% of warehouses, some type of Industry 4.0 technology, such as sensors, robotics and automation, or predictive analytics is adopted. In road freight, 35–40% of companies implemented transportation management systems and other technologies that optimize operations. In sea freight, shipping companies are cautiously embracing the digital transformation so that few carriers use modern ways to connect with their customers, e.g. via marketplaces. In air freight, carrier connectivity lags even behind ocean carriers, where companies struggle to implement digital solutions that do not immediately lead to cost benefits. In courier, express, and parcel delivery, various technologies are already mature and available but still in early rollout phases. Regarding logistics services and advisory, just half of the customers are satisfied with their 3PLs' IT capabilities. While the state of digitalization for traditional industry players is overall on a low to medium level, an increasing number of companies understood the impact that the digital transformation will have on them and intend to follow the call of the times, ready to overcome barriers such as high costs, lack of standards, and unclear benefits. Companies that do not proactively adapt their digital strategy will not only be left behind but also vanish faster and more surprisingly than this was the case in the past.","","9781119646457","10.1002/9781119646495.ch25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9430833.pdf&bkn=9430782&pdfType=chapter","","Seaports;Containers;Digital transformation;Airports;Robots;Ports (computers);Supply chains","","1","","","","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

However, the heterogeneity of communication protocols hinders connectivity among assets due to lack of interoperability. Moreover, the decomposition of the classical production hierarchy towards decentralized self-organization makes the implementation of interoperability in industrial environments key to help decision-making. In this sense, the interoperability of heterogeneous assets (e.g., external, internal, and human) has been defined as hyperconnectivity and supposes a technological challenge in the scientific literature. To prove this novel hyperconnectivity definition, the authors propose and develop a novel hyperconnected demonstrator where all types of assets are interconnected in a case study consisting of the automation of an inspection process. For this purpose, an industrial internet platform has been used for connecting industrial equipment creating a collaborative environment through the use of interoperability. In this regard, it has been possible to communicate assets among the cloud, humans, and CPS with a processing time of less than 10 ms, which demonstrates that the technological challenge of implementing the hyperconnectivity concept of this paper has been successfully addressed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3294308","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation project(grant numbers:PID2019-108277GB-C21/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); Universidad de León; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10177958","Hyperconnectivity;industrial communications;interoperability;smart manufacturing","Protocols;Production;Interoperability;Collaboration;Decision making;Industrial Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Industrial communication;Smart manufacturing","","1","","59","CCBYNCND","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To meet these requirements, this paper presents a novel intralogistics system based on the functionality of a planar motor. Following the operating principle of a moving stator, the vehicles are entirely passive and the hardware for the generation of motion is integrated into the floor. This is achieved in the form of compact, decentrally interconnected floor units, several of which are simultaneously involved in a motion. In order to control this system with satisfactory reliability and performance, the theoretical foundations for a proper understanding of the system are examined before a system model is derived and parameterized through measurements. On this basis a specifically designed motion control system is developed, that features precise planar movement, decentralized computation and compensation of position dependent characteristics. Thereafter, a method for model-based parameterization is outlined, that takes into account robustness against disturbances and parameter variations. Finally, the developed approach is implemented on the actual hardware and validated in experimental investigations in terms of path accuracy.","2163-5145","979-8-3503-9971-4","10.1109/ISIE51358.2023.10227969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227969","Control systems;Motion control;Logistics;Permanent magnet motors","Computational modeling;Stators;Control systems;Throughput;Robustness;Mathematical models;Hardware","","","","31","IEEE","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to these problems, a platform based on STM32F4 with ARM Cortex-M4 core, integrated FPU floating-point arithmetic unit and DSP instruction set is designed to predicting maintenance, data acquisition and calculation. Meanwhile, the platform processes some sensor data acquisition units with an 8-channel parallel port 16bit A/D sampling module, which maximum sampling frequency is 200Ksps. The results indicated that the data collection platform can effectively acquire various types of monitoring data, and the peak-to-peak error of the collected vibration parameters is less than 4%. Moreover, the platform is not only competent for data frequency spectrum analysis, but also envelope spectrum analysis, the demand of edge computing, real-time analysis, as well as processes flexible layout.","2689-6621","978-1-7281-8028-1","10.1109/IAEAC50856.2021.9391123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9391123","Coal mine;Electrical Equipment;Predictive Maintenance;ARM;Intelligent Manufacturing","Layout;Real-time systems;Coal mining;Wind turbines;Spectral analysis;Monitoring;Predictive maintenance","","","","15","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the content of AAS has been discussed from different perspectives, there is no standard implementation method for a general AAS currently. In this paper, we propose an AAS implementation method based on OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA), which realizes the virtualization of industrial assets and shields the underlying protocols.

The current development of our LIMS instrument is for an application on a robotic mission within the Artemis CLPS program of NASA. The CLPS lander will be placed in the south polar region. The LIMS system consists of a time-of-flight mass analyzer (TOF-MS), a laser system (LSS) providing nano-second laser pulses focused to um spots on the sample surface, electronics (ELU) for operating the LIMS system, and a sample handling system (SHS). The TOF-MS, LSS, and ELU are according to our established design presented earlier. The SHS is specially designed for the CLPS lander to collect regolith grains from the lunar surface in the vicinity of the lander. The SHS design foresees rotating steel brushes that free regolith grains from the surface into ballistic trajectories. A conveyor belt collects these grains, which is electrically biased to improve its collection efficiency. Adjusting the speed of the brushes and the voltage on the conveyor belt allow to optimize the collection efficiency of the grains. The conveyor belt transports the grains to the entrance of the mass analyzer where grain by grain analysis will be performed. The main scientific objective for the LIMS instrument is the geochemical analysis of the lunar regolith, by the analysis of individual regolith grains and assessing their mineralogical diversity. In addition, this investigation will also address technical aspects of sampling a planetary surface at or near a landed spacecraft, i.e., the effect the plume of the retrorockets has on the regolith underneath the lander. Of particular interest is the chemical contamination of the surface by the spent fuel, and the amount of removal grains by the gas drag.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-9032-0","10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115714","Swiss National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10115714","","Brushes;Surface contamination;Instruments;Moon;Surface emitting lasers;Voltage;Belts","","","","31","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Minimizing forecast errors can improve the supplier-consumer relationship by reducing supplier balancing costs, which can lower the energy bill, and anticipate possible network faults or network congestion which means improved operation across the entire power system. The present paper aims at demonstrating the usefulness of energy forecasting by using machine learning methods. In the context of installing monitoring systems with load curve recording data at short intervals of time, huge amounts of data are obtained that need to be capitalized in real time (automated), otherwise the investments necessary to modernize the way in which the energy is used are not justified, consequently disfavouring the development and digitization of electrical networks. Integration of the industrial consumer into the smart grid concept can be applied in detail at large industrial consumers where forecasts can be made on certain areas inside factories or electric equipment with high installed electric capacity. The use of smart grid technologies removes the current limits for monitoring, processing and communication between consumption and production. To be able to capitalize on the forecasts, a very important aspect is the automation of their realization and quick access to the decision makers who may be human or other smart grid integrated systems. That is why the present paper proposes the use of machine learning methods in the short and very short forecast, and the results will be compared with the classical forecasting methods. Hourly load curves from the industrial consumers will be used for forecasts.","","978-1-7281-0750-9","10.1109/MPS.2019.8759707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8759707","load forecasting;machine learning;smart grid;demand response;multilinear regression;python;tensorflow;keras","Smart grids;Production;Forecasting;Machine learning;Monitoring;Machine learning algorithms","","","","35","IEEE","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The intentions behind it have been to provide a critique of contemporary interface culture, and how it is a designed and produced reality. Interface criticism is not a new thing. Although the computer interface has a longer history, it gained particular cultural importance in the 1980s and 1990s. In Ridley Scott's famous advertisement video for the first Apple Macintosh computer (broadcast during the 1984 US Super Bowl finals), a blond, athletic woman runs into a hall where gray, expressionless zombie humans are marching and mindlessly watching a large screen. With clear references to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, she is pursued by the thought police, but throws her hammer into the screen at the exact moment when Big Brother exclaims, “We will prevail!” A comforting male voice takes over and reads a message: “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984.”1 The Macintosh is the human voice that contrasts the manipulating dictatorial enemy. The 1984 Macintosh marks the commercial breakthrough of personal computing with a graphical user interface—a world that responds to the users' needs and desires, contrary to corporate computers and the command line operating system of IBM's PC that was its main contender on the market at the time.","","9780262346559","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8544183.pdf&bkn=8544151&pdfType=chapter","","Cultural differences;Media;Industries;History;Tools;Software;Military computing","","","","","","13 Dec 2018","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Our system collects dense coloured points of the scene from different positions of a 3D laser scanner. Firstly, the accumulated point cloud is segmented into merchandise points and building-structure points using the MLSAC algorithm. The merchandise points are again segmented and classified according to a particular object model database. The system has been trained using a supervised learning algorithm with patterns based on the shape and colour of the merchandise object. The output is a 3D semantic model of the scene in which the recognised objects are placed in precise positions. An assessment of the storehouse in terms of stock, occupied/non-occupied volumes and a suggestion of the placement of new incoming packages is also carried out. The scanning platform is composed of a mobile robot carrying a 3D laser scanner and a DLSR camera that follows a pre-established path for each specific scenario.

The existing research on cyber-threats related to smart manufacturing system does not consider the comprehensive landscape of denial of service attacks. In this study, we classify well-accepted (distributed) denial of service attacks according to a proposed taxonomy, focusing on both the multi-vector attacks and cross-domain attacks. Utilising the taxonomy, more than fifty different denial of service attacks on smart manufacturing system were classified in terms of Endpoint and Network (distributed) denial of service attacks. As an example, a Cyber-Physical Conveyor System was used to examine the proposed taxonomy.","","978-1-7281-7568-3","10.1109/INDIN51773.2022.9976172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976172","Industrial Cyber-Physical System;Denial of Service;cross-domain attack;smart manufacturing systems","Manufacturing processes;Simulation;Taxonomy;Product design;Quality assessment;Personnel;History","","","","38","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While sophisticated modeling languages like SysML describe systems and their components, data often ends up in purpose-built relational and time series databases. To generate value, information must be retrieved and integrated from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose an innovative method for leveraging SysML engineering models and database queries by combining them in a collaborative low-code web environment. First, we make heterogeneous databases available via GraphQL, a state-of-the-art approach for building Web APIs. Then, our web application enables domain experts to exploit containment relations in SysML models to connect diverse data sources. The outcome is an integrated GraphQL API that matches the engineering model structures by resembling views across multiple database sources. The discussed approach incorporates the benefits of data-oriented development and low-code platforms beyond the business automation domain.","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00139","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(grant numbers:390621612); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350817","Low-Code;Data Integration;Data-Driven Applications;Manufacturing;Industry 4.0;Model-Driven Software Engineering;SysML;Engineering Models","Manufacturing industries;Heart;Databases;Soft sensors;Time series analysis;Collaboration;Data models","","","","26","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If necessary, these areas are further subjected to decomposition to obtain finer separation of regions. After the preprocessing, the binarization can be done either by GMM to estimate a binarization threshold for each region, or the binarization problem is treated as an image-translation task and hence the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) is trained using the high or low contrast areas as conditional inputs.","","978-1-7281-5604-0","10.1109/AIVR46125.2019.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8942258","morphology, binarization, image downsizing, gaussian mixture model, deep learning, cGAN","Training;Generative adversarial networks;Oceans;Gray-scale;Thresholding (Imaging);Generators;Decoding","","","","8","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Discount online providers used search engine optimization to build dominant market positions, leaving incumbents with little choice but to respond by going online themselves to compete against both digital entrants and each other on pricing—rather than on reputation and relationships.","","9780262352642","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8661268.pdf&bkn=8654470&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","7 Mar 2019","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

In order to reduce the time complexity of the original algorithm and improve the efficiency of constructing and mining FP tree, this algorithm deeply analyzes some hidden trouble data, mining strong association rules among frequent items to limit the hidden risk factors in association rules, in order to effectively avoid the occurrence of some accidents or reduce their losses. The results showed that the improved algorithm is more efficient than the traditional Apriori algorithm and FP-growth algorithm in the construction and mining of FP tree when the database changes, which shows the practicability of the algorithm, and for the coal industry to eliminate hidden danger work to provide better development support.","2693-2776","978-1-7281-8535-4","10.1109/IMCEC51613.2021.9482027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9482027","Coal mine hidden danger;Improved FP-growth algorithm;Project augmented matrix;Association rules","Coal industry;Itemsets;Process control;Coal mining;Safety;Information management;Sparse matrices","","","","8","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To build an industrial control systems (ICS) lab with real hardware and control software usually requires a significant amount of finances. However, the lab equipment is usually accessible only to a limited number of students. A possible alternative is a blended classroom environment that combines real inexpensive devices connected with a configurable simulation environment. In such an environment, groups of students can create their own experiments and observe a near real-life behavior of an ICS system.In this paper we demonstrate how a blended ICS classroom can be built of the Factory I/O 3D software simulator and real UniPi PLC devices equipped with digital and analog inputs. Using such an environment, students may design a set of nontrivial manufacturing scenarios, e.g., a production line, and make experiments with ICS components. The paper presents the topology and equipment of the blended ICS classroom. We also introduce two lab scenarios focused on the security of ICS processes and analysis of Modbus communication in the ICS environment.","2472-7687","978-1-7281-9327-4","10.1109/EAEEIE50507.2021.9530927","Technology Agency of the Czech Republic; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530927","simulation;industrial system;blended classroom;ICS security;ICS testbed","Integrated circuits;Three-dimensional displays;Software design;Software packages;Industrial control;Education;Production facilities","","","","14","IEEE","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Authenticity was the “it” factor that candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders had, and that Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush lacked.1 According to a New York Times-CBS News poll taken December 4-8, 2015—a period during which Trump led the winnowing field of Republican hopefuls—76 percent of those polled believed that Trump “says what he believes most of the time [rather than] … what he thinks people want to hear.“2 Sanders had a similarly high figure (62 percent).3 In contrast, Clinton stood at 52 percent and Jeb Bush at 41 percent.4 Based on this and other polls, news outlets from the Atlantic to Time to the Wall Street Journal regularly debated Trump's role as the “authenticity” candidate.","","9780262367264","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9626358.pdf&bkn=9616972&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","24 Nov 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"
